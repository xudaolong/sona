## 🔌 OpenAI-Compatible API

Sona speaks the OpenAI API, so existing clients just work.

```shell
wget https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp/raw/refs/heads/master/samples/jfk.wav -O sample.wav
pip install openai
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:11531/v1",
    api_key="sona",
)

with open("sample.wav", "rb") as f:
    result = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
        model="ggml-base.bin",
        file=f,
    )

print(result.text)
```
